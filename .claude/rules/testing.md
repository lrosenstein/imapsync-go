# Testing rules

## What "covered" means here

- A change is covered when every behavioural branch the change introduced is exercised by a test that would fail if the branch broke.
- Coverage % is a guideline, not a gate. Coverage of error paths and invariants matters more than total %.
- `go test -cover -coverprofile=cover.out ./...` and `go tool cover -func=cover.out` are the source of truth.

## What we test

- **`internal/config`** — JSON+YAML loading (both extensions), validation, defaults (worker clamp, rate-limit nil case), env interpolation.
- **`internal/client`** — error classification, cache invalidation on create, fetch batching boundaries, reconnect generation bump, Select-cache short-circuit, AppendMessage streaming (no ReadAll).
- **`internal/ratelimit`** — token starvation, nil-limiter pass-through, read+write directions independent.
- **`internal/utils`** — `AskConfirm` and friends; trivial but they cover the `-y/--confirm` flow.
- **`internal/app`** — sync plan diff (Message-Id intersection), subfolder expansion, delimiter reconciliation, worker pool dispatch.
- **`internal/progress`** — interface compliance against the contract `internal/client` expects.

## What we deliberately don't test

If something is hard to test, it must be either tested at integration level or documented as a deliberate exclusion in `CLAUDE.md` with reasoning. Examples of acceptable exclusions:

- The TLS handshake itself (delegated to stdlib).
- `goreleaser` output (delegated to goreleaser).
- The `urfave/cli/v3` flag parsing wiring in `cmd/imapsync-go/main.go` (declarative; failure mode is a CLI parse error from the library).

### `internal/client` deliberate exclusions (added with P3.1 fake-server suite)

- **`client.New` full constructor** — covered transitively by every fake-server test through `connectAndLogin`. The TLS dial path is delegated to stdlib and covered at integration level.
- **`Client.SetPrefix`, `Client.GetDelimiter`** — trivial one-liners; observable in all fake-server tests that set a delimiter.
- **`Client.SetProgressTracker`** — symmetric with `SetProgressWriter`; both are nil-and-non-nil atomic.Pointer stores already exercised by `SetProgressWriter` tests.
- **`realSleepCtx`** — production sleep implementation. Tests substitute the package-level `sleepCtx` var; the real implementation is stdlib `time.NewTimer` and its correctness is delegated to stdlib.
- **`Client.getFolderSize`** — requires the fake server to emit `RFC822.SIZE` in FETCH responses, which it currently does not. Used only by `show`; observable in smoke tests.
- **`AppendMessage` mid-APPEND transient retry** — the streaming-literal design (`msg.GetBody(...)` handed straight to `cli.Append`, no `io.ReadAll`) means the literal has been partially consumed before a mid-APPEND error is detected. There is nothing to retry: the literal stream is exhausted. Idempotency is recovered by the next sync run's Message-Id diff. This path is architecturally untestable in isolation without a mock that simulates a partial-write failure mid-literal, which would not test real go-imap behaviour.
- **`safeCall` post-reconnect `isCancelled()` branch** — exercising it requires `Cancel()` to race between reconnect-completion and retry-fn dispatch. The window is a single `c.isCancelled()` call; deterministic coverage would require a production hook (e.g. an injected callback between reconnect and retry), which adds test-only complexity with no safety benefit beyond the existing `Cancel` interrupt tests.
- **`connectAndLogin` `imapclient.New` failure branch** (`internal/client/client.go:369-373`) — fires only when the server accepts the TCP connection but closes it before sending the IMAP greeting. The branch is `_ = conn.Close(); return err` — no imapsync logic. Exercising it would test go-imap's greeting-read error handling, which is delegated to that library. The `stallingLoginHandler` approach already covers the normal greeting path; a "silent close" handler buys no coverage of imapsync-owned code.

### `internal/app` deliberate exclusions (added with B.1a fake-server suite)

- **`ActionSync`, `ActionShow`** — top-level urfave/cli action entry points; require a fully running config and live IMAP connections. Tested implicitly through their sub-functions (`buildSyncPlan`, `expandMappingsWithSubfolders`, `runFolderSync`, `newSyncWorkerPool`), each at 80–100% line coverage.
- **`printAccountInfo`** — go-pretty table renderer hitting `os.Stdout` directly. A meaningful test requires either a refactor to take `io.Writer` (out of scope for B.1a) or stdout capture; neither buys coverage of real behaviour because the function is a thin layout wrapper.
- **`runFolderSync` post-append `ctx.Err()` check** — guards against a successful in-flight append continuing iteration after Ctrl+C. Architecturally unreachable in a fake-server test: `withCancel(ctx)` terminates the IMAP connection when ctx is canceled, so `cli.Append` always returns an error rather than nil in that window. The observable `(synced, errors)` outcome is identical with or without the check; it shaves at most one wasted iteration in the race between cancellation and a completing append.

- **`FetchMessageMap` all-empty-headers fallback collision** — when a message has no `Message-Id` and also no `From`, `Date`, or `Subject`, the fallback key hashes size only, so two such messages in the same folder with equal size yield the same key and only one is synced. This is logged as a warning via the progress writer (covered by `Test_FetchMessageMap_allEmptyHeadersLogsWarning`). The collision itself is not specifically tested because it requires two structurally identical headerless messages; the degenerate case is a strict improvement over always skipping such messages, and cannot be distinguished by any deterministic key.

If the tester finds an untested branch that does not match an existing exclusion, the choice is:

1. Add a test (preferred).
2. If the branch is genuinely untestable in isolation (e.g. network races), propose an integration test or add it to the exclusions list with reasoning.

## Test commands

- `just test` — full suite.
- `go test ./internal/client -run TestFunc` — single test.
- `go test -race ./...` — race detector. Run before declaring done on anything that touches goroutines.
- `go test -cover ./internal/<pkg>` — coverage for one package.
- `go test -coverprofile=cover.out ./... && go tool cover -func=cover.out | sort -k3 -n` — coverage report sorted by % (find the holes fast).

## When a test fails

- Do not "fix" by adjusting the assertion to match observed behaviour. Find the regression.
- If the failure is in a test the developer just wrote and the new code is correct, the test is wrong — fix the test, explain in the developer→architect report.
- If the failure is in a pre-existing test, stop. Report to architect. Do not modify pre-existing tests without explicit instruction.

## Race detector

`just run` runs `go run -race`. If you introduce concurrency, run `go test -race ./...` locally and report the result.
