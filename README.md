# imapsync-go

`imapsync-go` is a lightweight Go CLI that mirrors folders between two IMAP accounts. It builds a sync plan from message IDs, streams mail bodies directly between servers.

> **Note:** This project was created in collaboration with the Claude Code.

## Motivation

This tool was built to provide a **simple, fast, and dependency-free** solution for IMAP synchronization. Key goals:

- **Zero dependencies** - Single static binary with no external requirements
- **Cross-platform** - Works on Linux and macOS (amd64/arm64)
- **Efficient** - Parallel workers for fast synchronization
- **Simple** - Easy configuration via JSON or YAML

Unlike heavyweight alternatives, `imapsync-go` focuses on doing one thing well: efficiently copying IMAP folders between servers.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew tap greeddj/tap
brew install imapsync-go
```

### Docker

Pull the image from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
# Latest version
podman pull ghcr.io/greeddj/imapsync-go:latest
# or
podman pull ghcr.io/greeddj/imapsync-go:1.0.0
```

### Binary Release

Download pre-built binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/greeddj/imapsync-go/releases):

```bash
# Example for Linux amd64
curl -LO https://github.com/greeddj/imapsync-go/releases/latest/download/imapsync-go_<version>_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
tar xzf imapsync-go_<version>_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
chmod +x imapsync-go
sudo mv imapsync-go /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage

### Configuration

Create a configuration file (`config.json` or `config.yaml`):

**JSON example:**

```json
{
  "src": {
    "label": "Source",
    "server": "imap.source.com:993",
    "user": "user@source.com",
    "pass": "password"
  },
  "dst": {
    "label": "Destination",
    "server": "imap.dest.com:993",
    "user": "user@dest.com",
    "pass": "password"
  },
  "map": [
    {"src": "INBOX", "dst": "INBOX"},
    {"src": "Sent", "dst": "Sent Items"}
  ]
}
```

**YAML example:**

```yaml
src:
  label: Source
  server: imap.source.com:993
  user: user@source.com
  pass: password

dst:
  label: Destination
  server: imap.dest.com:993
  user: user@dest.com
  pass: password

map:
  - src: INBOX
    dst: INBOX
  - src: Sent
    dst: Sent Items
```

### Running with Homebrew

```bash
export IMAPSYNC_CONFIG="/Users/$(whoami)/.imapsync/prod_config.json"

# Show available folders
imapsync-go show

# Sync all configured folders
imapsync-go sync -w 4

# Sync specific folder
imapsync-go sync -s INBOX -d INBOX
imapsync-go sync -s 'Test.[some_group].box' -d 'Test/some_group/box'

# Auto-confirm without prompt
imapsync-go sync -y
```

### Running with Docker

```bash

# show folders
podman run --rm \
-v /Users/$(whoami)/.imapsync/prod_config.json:/config.json ghcr.io/greeddj/imapsync-go:latest \
-c /config.json \
show

# sync folders
podman run --rm -it \
-v /Users/$(whoami)/.imapsync/prod_config.json:/config.json ghcr.io/greeddj/imapsync-go:latest \
-c /config.json \
sync -w 4
```

### Command-line Options

**Global flags:**

- `-c, --config` - Path to configuration file (default: `config.json`)

**Show command:**

- `-V, --verbose` - Show additional detail (env: `IMAPSYNC_VERBOSE`)
- `-q, --quiet` - Suppress progress bars; output is plain text suitable for piping (env: `IMAPSYNC_QUIET`)

**Sync command:**

- `-s, --src-folder` - Source folder (overrides config) (env: `IMAPSYNC_SOURCE_FOLDER`)
- `-d, --dest-folder` - Destination folder (overrides config) (env: `IMAPSYNC_DESTINATION_FOLDER`)
- `-w, --workers` - Number of parallel workers (default: 4, max: 10) (env: `IMAPSYNC_WORKERS`)
- `-y, --confirm, --yes` - Auto-confirm without prompt (env: `IMAPSYNC_CONFIRM`)
- `-V, --verbose` - Enable verbose output (env: `IMAPSYNC_VERBOSE`)
- `-q, --quiet` - Suppress non-error output (env: `IMAPSYNC_QUIET`)
- `--bps-down` - Max bytes/sec read from the source server (0 = unlimited) (env: `IMAPSYNC_BPS_DOWN`)
- `--bps-up` - Max bytes/sec written to the destination server (0 = unlimited) (env: `IMAPSYNC_BPS_UP`)
- `--max-connections` - Hard cap on simultaneous IMAP connections per side (0 = no cap). One slot is reserved for the planning client, so `--max-connections=N` allows at most N−1 sync workers. (env: `IMAPSYNC_MAX_CONNECTIONS`)

The same `bps-down`, `bps-up`, and `max-connections` values can be set in config under a `rate_limit` block (`down_bps`, `up_bps`, `max_connections`). CLI flags take precedence when both are set.

## Provider quotas (Gmail)

When either side is `imap.gmail.com`, `imapsync-go` prints a warning before
the confirm prompt with the relevant Workspace IMAP limits:

- 15 simultaneous IMAP connections per account
- 2,500 MB/day download, 500 MB/day upload via IMAP
- Exceeding the bandwidth limit suspends the account for 1–24 hours

For Gmail, run with explicit throttling so the daily quotas don't trigger an
account lockout mid-migration:

```bash
imapsync-go sync \
  --bps-down 300000 \
  --bps-up 300000 \
  --max-connections 10 \
  -w 9
```

`--max-connections 10` reserves one slot for the planning client, leaving 9
slots for workers. `-w 9` matches that ceiling; setting `-w` higher than
`maxConn−1` is harmless — the cap is enforced automatically.

The defaults (no throttle) match `imapsync`'s default behaviour — they're
appropriate for self-hosted IMAP servers on a LAN, not for big-provider
mailboxes.

## Notes

- **Ctrl-C** exits with code 130 and prints `Cancelled.` — this is the standard Unix convention for SIGINT termination and makes it composable in shell scripts.
- **`--version` on source builds** makes one HTTPS request to the GitHub releases API to fetch the latest tag. Set `IMAPSYNC_OFFLINE=1` or run inside a CI environment (any non-empty `CI` variable) to skip that call and fall back to the build-time default.

## Idempotency caveats

`imapsync-go` decides what to copy by diffing message **`Message-Id`** headers
between source and destination. This is fast and re-running a partial sync is
safe, but it has two known limitations:

- **Messages without a `Message-Id` use a fallback sync key.** Drafts, some
  bulk mail, and messages from broken senders may not have one. For these,
  `imapsync-go` derives a sync key from SHA-256(`From` + `Date` + `Subject` +
  `RFC822.SIZE`). The key is stable across runs so idempotency is preserved.
  The CLI logs how many messages in each folder used the fallback. If a message
  has no `Message-Id` *and* no `From`, `Date`, or `Subject` headers, the key
  hashes size only; two such messages with the same size in the same folder
  would collide and only one would be synced — this is an extremely rare edge
  case and is warned about separately.
- **Servers that rewrite `Message-Id` on `APPEND` will cause duplicates on
  re-run.** A few IMAP servers (notably some Exchange configurations) replace
  the inbound `Message-Id` with their own value. The diff on the next run will
  see the original IDs as still "missing" on the destination and re-upload
  them. If you suspect this, do the sync in a single pass and avoid re-running
  it against the same destination.

## Known issues

### Ctrl+C may not exit immediately during a network disruption

During a sync, if the network connection drops mid-transfer, pressing Ctrl+C
may take up to a few minutes to fully cancel. The underlying IMAP client cannot
interrupt a transfer that is waiting on a server response that never arrives
(because the server is unreachable). TCP keepalive will eventually detect the
dead connection — typically within a few minutes on macOS and Linux — and the
program will exit cleanly once that happens.

If you need to abort immediately, press Ctrl+\ instead. This dumps all
goroutine stacks to stderr and exits right away; it is the escape hatch for
when the program appears stuck.
